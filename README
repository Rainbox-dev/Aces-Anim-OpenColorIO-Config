This repository contains simplified and adjusted OpenColorUI ACES configs, to be used in animation.

We tweaked a bit the original configurations from *Sony Pictures Imageworks*, and removed all camera-specific color profiles to make things simpler when working in full animation pipelines, which don't need these profiles.

This new version of the ACES config is especially suited for working with [Blender](http://blender.org), as Blender does not filter all the color spaces, making it difficult to work with too many of them. This version of the config fixes that by removing un-needed profiles.

If you need to get back specific color spaces, it should be pretty easy to grab it [from the original config](https://github.com/imageworks/OpenColorIO-Configs).
